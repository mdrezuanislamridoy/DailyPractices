//7. Write a Java program to create a class called Student with private instance variables student_id, student_name, and grades. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the student_id and student_name variables. However, provide a method called addGrade() that allows adding a grade to the grades variable while performing additional validation.

package Encapsulation.Practice;

class Student{
    private int student_id;
    private String student_name;

    //this is a question of array list .. I will explore it soon
    

}
public class q7 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}
